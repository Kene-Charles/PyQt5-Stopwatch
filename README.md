## 📖 How It Works
- Uses QTimer to track elapsed time.
- The Start button starts the timer.
- The Stop button pauses the timer without resetting.
- The Reset button sets the time back to 00:00:00:00.
- The GUI is designed with QVBoxLayout and QHBoxLayout.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Add Lap Timer functionality
- Add Dark/Light themes
- Export recorded times to a file (CSV/JSON)
